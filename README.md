# Simple React Starter

This is a simple React app boilerplate for quick prototypes. This app uses a simple Webpack dev server set-up and a simple gh-pages deployment.

## Set-up

### Prerequisites

Requires Node and a related package manager (yarn/npm)

### Development Set-up

1. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
2. run `yarn start` to start dev server
3. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for the dev server page

### Deployment to Github Pages

Deployment depends on this being a proper github repositiory. 

1. Run `yarn deploy` to build and upload to the gh-pages branch of the repo. This will automatically deploy to Github pages.

2. Visit https://[user].github.io/[project repo name] to see the deployed page
